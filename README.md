# In essence, a Promise in JavaScript is a lot like a promise made in real life. As promises in real life are either kept or broken, JavaScript Promises get either resolved or rejected.

## In JavaScript, a Promise takes in two callbacks: resolve and reject. Reading through the above code, it is evident that our small child fulfilled his promise to clean his room. Therefore, our Promise object here— once called upon— will resolve to return 'Clean' as its response. Suppose our child failed to keep his end of the bargain — then isClean would be set to false. Then our Promise here will get rejected and return not Clean as its response.
